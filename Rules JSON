  "description": "1. Use channels accordingly \n Just try your best to keep things in the right channel \n\n 2. No DOXXING or anything even remotely similar \n Self explanatory \n\n3. Keep messages in the right channels \n\n4. Do NOT flirt with those who are underage \n We have age roles, there is no excuse to be like this. \n\n5. Follow Discord TOS (Terms Of Service) \n If you are found to be violating the TOS, you will be banned from here. Do that shit elsewhere \n\n6. Do not argue with any \"Gulag\" role. \n Whatever the admins say, goes. We have very nice admins here, I doubt anything they do would be unreasonable but if you think they have acted unjustly you can DM any of our head admins, or owner.\n\n 7. No gore allowed under and circumstances, you should know your limits, but if absolutely necessary DM an admin and they will decide if it is allowed.\n\n 8. It shouldn't need to be said, but just for clarification. Don't spam ping. I shouldn't need to say any more. \n\n 9. This one is honestly mostly satire, but no Nikocado Avacado, I will not hesitate to abuse my power. \n\n10. If you have a problem with another user or vise versa, admins have the right to resolve it if need be. Essentially, keep your conflicts in DMS.",
